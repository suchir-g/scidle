                If you don't know how to play the original <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">WORDLE</a>, check that out before playing
                this game.

            <p>A <span class="green-text">green</span> tile means that the tile is in the word and in the right
                position.</p>
            <p>An example of this would be <span class="green-text">He</span> as it is in the word, and in the right
                place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A <span class="yellow-text">yellow</span> tile means that the tile is in the word but not in the right
                place.</p>
            <p>An example of this would be <span class="yellow-text">Er</span> as it is in the word, but in the last
                position instead of the 2nd.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A <span class="blue-text">blue</span> tile means that the tile is not in the word, but a similar tile is.
            </p>
            <p>An example of this would be <span class="blue-text">Pa</span>, as it isn't in the word but <span
                    class="green-text">Pt</span> is, and
                they are very close</p>
            <br>
            <p>A grey tile means that the tile is not in the word at all, and nothing similar is in the tile as well.
            </p>
            <p>For example <span class="grey-text">Ti</span> isn't in the word, and nothing similar is in the word. This
                means that for example <span class="grey-text">Ta</span> wouldn't be in the word
                as it is similar to <span class="grey-text">Ti</span>.
